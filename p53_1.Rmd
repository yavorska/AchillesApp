To have a rough idea of whether p53 wt and mut cell behave differently when subjected to MDM4 knockout, one can simply plot the LFC scores as before in the *Consistency* plot but colour code the cell lines according to p53 status.

In the default, we see the effect of MDM4 shRNAs on the seven skin cancers in the data. Based on the boxplots, there does seem to be a difference in how the different p53 classes are affected. *Note: Because there are so few cell lines, one cannot draw any robust conclusions here but visualising the effects based on class is still very useful.*
